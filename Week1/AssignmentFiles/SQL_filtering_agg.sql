group by order_id;
 

-- Q2) Compute total items per order for PAID orders only.
--     Return (order_id, total_items). Hint: order_id IN (SELECT ... FROM orders WHERE status='paid').

where order_id in (select order_id from orders where status='paid')
group by order_id;

-- Q3) How many orders were placed per day (all statuses)?
--     Return (order_date, orders_count) from orders.

select date(order_datetime), count(order_id) as orders_count
from orders
group by date(order_datetime);

-- Q4) What is the average number of items per PAID order?
--     Use a subquery or CTE over order_items filtered by order_id IN (...).

--     Return (product_id, total_units), sorted desc.

-- Q6) Among PAID orders only, which product_ids have the most units sold?
